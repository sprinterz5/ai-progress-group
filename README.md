# Startum Kids Landing Page

This repository previously mirrored a deployment owned by Gulmira's Vercel team. The
automated links have been removed so it can now operate as an independent project.

## Overview

The app is built with Next.js. You can run it locally with `pnpm dev` (or your
preferred Node.js package manager) and deploy it using your own hosting setup.

## Getting started

1. Install dependencies with `pnpm install`.
2. Start the development server with `pnpm dev`.
3. Update this README with any deployment details that match your new workflow.
